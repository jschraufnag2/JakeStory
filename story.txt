Once upon a time there was a boy named Joe. Joe was a curious kid, and loved to get into trouble. 
One day Joe's curiosity took over and changed his life forever.
It was a normal day like the others. Joe got up early. After finishing breakfast, he said bye to his mother and left home for school.
But when Joe went out the door, he went in the complete opposite direction of school. Joe started making his way 
towards the arcade, where he could spend the whole day playing games. When Joe got to the arcade, he met up with some of his friends who also decided to take a day off of school. They spent hours at the arcade, until they ran out of  quarters and decided to head home.
