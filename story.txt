Once upon a time there was a boy named Joe. Joe was a curious kid, and loved to get into trouble. 
One day Joe's curiosity took over and changed his life forever.
It was a normal day like the others. Joe got up early. After finishing breakfast, he said bye to his mother and left home for school.
On his way to school, he saw children building snowman and playing snowball fight. He was curious which team would win. He spent two hours there and was late for class.
